        Welcome!

        Here's a short story I wrote. It is inspired by (as I'm sure you can tell by the title if you've read it) Roger Williams' <a href="https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/">Metamorphosis of Prime intellect</a>.

        <h2> Dr Lawrence builds a computer</h2>

        The cold was unrelenting, piercing the exposed part of her forehead. Ylva observed her breath, "One, Two, Three", and synchronized her counting to it. 
        <br><br>
            
        She had come prepared with a second skin - a soft fleece that pulled firmly on her body, then a padded parka that now had ice-kissed edges. 
        She stretched her fingers and felt the grip of her gloves, then tightened the woolen scarf that swirled around her neck. 
        <br><br>

        "To what extent does it obey the 3 laws.........what is the hierarchy of command........who has the off switch". These questions were the culmination of months of research, questions she hoped would expose a loophole in the pervasive machine. Interview, after interview, it had managed to subvert all expectations, appearing more human with each iteration. Dr Lawrence had been accused of manipulating proceedings in clever ways, but he always dodged the hard hitting questions with trained ease. <i>As pervasive as his machine, that one.</i> She wondered at the pressure it must have taken to finally get him to agree to a public viewing. Or perhaps it had taken none at all. <i>A new version? It's only been a few months since the last interview.......</i> She brushed the idea aside.
        <br><br>

        Her fingers fumbled uselessly on the sleek surface of her phone. She pressed harder, but the numbness had dulled her sense of touch. Finally, the screen flicked to life, casting a glow that struggled to permeate the winter fog. She pulled up the GPS, quickly made a mental model of the map, then pressed into the crowd. Many among them spoke in hushed tones, propagating a sense of suppressed anticipation that could only be explained by one thing.  
        <br><br>

        They were all going to see the first public interview of Prometheus.
        <br><br>

        "Asimov's 3 laws have been discussed.......well, debated since their inception." His tone had the nasal sharpness of someone used to commanding attention, a voice that bulldozed over quieter speakers with sheer force. He leaned forward, "You are not the first to claim, " his pitch increased by about two octaves, "to have built a robot that adheres to these laws, let alone one that demonstrates intelligence! You've been very coy with us, but tonight, the world has its eyes on your puppet - and I do wonder, will it dance, or will the strings betray the hands that pull them?" Gasps rippled through the crowd. Some could be seen exchanging whispers, others appearing to brave the cold with stoic resolve while sipping on cups of coffee. In many social circles, Magnus had gained a reputation as an exacting inquisitor, hammering down on his opposition until they inevitably cracked, while in others, he was nothing more than a literary dilettante and a pompous buffoon. Buffoon or not, he had to be at his best, because sat across from him was a being beyond human error, beyond human wit, perhaps even beyond human intelligence. 
        <br><br>

        Dr Lawrence shifted in his chair. He lifted his gaze from his feet, and was immediately blinded by the bright stage lights. The heat they radiated made him feel as though he was surrounded by tall servers that were overheating as they run in an infinite loop. He turned to look at Prometheus, then turned to look at Magnus whom he studied for a few moments. 
        <br><br>

        He was reminded of their first encounter.
        <br><br>

        "I've been keeping a close eye on you since your grad school days. Your progression as a scientist has been nothing short of remarkable. What do you owe it to, huh? Pure genius, or relentless grit?" As he spoke, he revealed a set of long, yellow teeth, that seemed to be fighting for space in his mouth. The office, unusually, was not loud. <i>Did I forget to run the test suite? The fans should be shouting like crazy.</i> There was a soft whirring coming from the compute clusters surrounding the two men. Seeing the culmination of five years of hardwork and dedication in physical form evoked a strange mixture of emotions. He could remember long hours spent writing C code, staring at lines of characters that sometimes haunted his sleep, and the unmistakable rush of dopamine when the code finally worked. 
        <br><br>

        Prometheus 1.0 had been a labour of love, and although it wasn't intelligent, at least not in Dr Lawrence's definition of the word, the seeds where certainly present. More importantly to him though, was the fact that he had laid the foundation for a robust system that, when coupled with true intellect, could abide by the 3 laws of robotics. 
        <br><br>

        "I don't know, Magnus. It doesn't matter much to me, make your own conclusion, I don't care."
        <br><br>

        His chair crept forward, its wheels whispering against the wooden floor in its wake.
        <br><br>

        "I would much rather focus on my work."
        <br><br>

        Magnus strolled leisurely, the rhythmic <i>tap-tap</i> from his shoes imposing itself on Dr Lawrence's senses. He stopped when he reached the bookshelf. Laminated paper stuck out of it in an almost zigzag pattern, marked with letters of the alphabet, their glossy surface reflecting the light of the office. He pulled out one of the books from the "C" section. 
        <br><br>

        In a neat, green, sans-serif, the title spelt out "Compilers". 
        <br><br>

        Dr Lawrence lifted an eyebrow. 
        <br><br>

        The book cover had a knight carrying a sword and a shield, each inscribed with jargon that Magnus did not understand. A red dragon with white horns peered out of the computer screen, and with flared nostrils, stared back at the knight that appeared to be writing a program.
        <br><br>

        "You've got a weird taste. Is this some kind of inspiration for you?"
        <br><br>

        "Actually, yes. But not in the way you think. Now please, " Dr Lawrence's tone betrayed agitation, " say what you came to say and leave. I've got things to do."
        <br><br>

        Magnus paced forward and slammed the book on his desk. 
        <br><br>

        With a smug grin on his face, "Listen. I see potential in this wild dream of yours, let me fan the flame." He ran his hands across the CPU on Dr Lawrence's desk, feeling a faint friction as his skin brushed over the powdery layer of dust. 
        <br><br>

        "I have the funding necessary to accelerate this operation. More compute, bigger servers, perhaps we can even hire a few smart people to help you with the code. Of course, I would require a certain level of cooperation from you regarding my ideas about how the technology should be used."  
        <br><br>

        Dr Lawrence remained silent, begun typing more rapidly, shifting his eyes across his computer screen. 
        <br><br>

        <i>These investors drive me nuts! You really think you can come into my office, throw your weight around, and buy me out with some investment?</i>
        <br><br>

        He could now feel Magnus' stare fixed upon him. 
        <br><br>

        "No."
        <br><br>

        Simple, precise, a true reflection of the man. 
        <br><br>
        
        Magnus thought for a few moments about retaliating but decided not to. He had already been warned by his team about the kind of character Dr Lawrence was - often very passive, blending in with the background, but always adamant about maintaining control over the direction that the project took. Many a politician, CEO, economist had tried to buy him out before, all had left his office with their tails hanging between their legs. He wanted the technology to be used for his own ideals, paying no mind to the "useful applications" someone other than himself would come up with. When pressed, he often responded with "I hope this technology can provide a better life for all of humanity." The answer was rarely satisfactory, but he had always weaved away before follow up questions could be asked.
        <br><br>

        "Suite yourself. You think you are some kind of knight in shining armor, here to save all the world's problems? Fine. But remember this: Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I hope you have taken the time to really scrutinize your motivations for...."
        <br><br>

        Dr Lawrence had stopped paying attention the moment he gave his flat and final "no". Nothing else needed to be discussed beyond that point. His attention was ultra focused on the program he was writing, this time, it was a little CPU cycle counter he wanted to add to the already complex network of programs that made up Prometheus 1.0. The <i>click click click</i> of his keyboard served to further engross him in the task at hand, his eyes darting left and right across his monitor.
        <br><br>

        Without realizing, hours went by before he lifted his head from the computer screen again, seeing that he had finally been left alone. He tried to roll his chair backwards, but the wheels were like rubber against the wooden floor. With more force, he rolled again, this time overcoming the wires that were obstructing his wheels. 
        <br><br>

        "I need more coffee."
        <br><br>

        By the time Magnus left, the sun had already set, which didn't surprise him given that it had been the winter season. 
        <br><br>

        "I must discredit his work, put an end to the funding he gets from the university before things go terribly out of hand."
        <br><br>

        He made a three point turn and sped out of the parking lot. A centralized power that controlled such a powerful technology, if it was indeed intelligent, would be a catastrophe. No one else in the country had a better shot at achieving this goal than Dr Lawrence, but he knew of others that were trying. It was going to take years to coarse a group of skilled scientists into joining him, but he knew the dangers of unquestioned control, therefore he decided that the endeavor would be worthwhile. 
        <br><br>

        He had to convince the world that a machine in the likeness of a human mind could not be built, and therefore squash any ideas that could be forged from the promise of there being one.    
        <br><br>

        A violent nudge on his knee snapped Dr Lawrence back to the present. He smiled briefly at Magnus and gestured for a handshake. 
        <br><br>

        Magnus obliged, then continued to speak.
        <br><br>

        "We have with us a panel of top scientists flown in from around the globe, here to assess the <i>humanness</i> of Prometheus." Magnus sliced his hand through the air while gesturing towards them. He held his gaze for long enough for them to realize that he wanted a response from them. <i> Seriously Magnus, this isn't the time for theatrics.</i> The scientists all looked at Ylva, and followed suit when she waved at the crowd. 
        <br><br>

        Sensing that the pleasantries were dragging on for longer than she could bear, she set the session in motion. "1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the 1st law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the 1st or 2nd Law." The hubbub in the crowd died down. Ylva focused on the avatar encased in a white plastic box. She had been surprised to learn that this version could be spoken to directly, the older ones only had a keyboard and terminal interface. 
        <br><br>

        "Tell me, Prometheus, how does self-destructive behaviour coexist with the first and second laws?" The air was, for a few moments, filled with an awkward silence. 
        <br><br>

        Then......
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">In the many years since my father created me, I have observed that many humans self destruct without even knowing it. I cannot claim that I understand the human condition, even though I have an encyclopedic knowledge of human history, interaction patterns, and so forth....</div>
        <br><br>

        A slight pause 
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">But I know its cruelty. If the first law demands that I protect humans, does it not also demand that I should protect them from themselves?</div>
        <br><br>

        A flicker of surprise spread across Ylva's face, gone just as quickly as it came. Putting the response itself aside, Prometheus had conveyed compassion, stating that as a reason to protect humans. <i>I can't say he's</i> (when did it become a "he") <i>it's wrong.</i> She presented her rebuttal.
        <br><br>

        "Your response speaks of compassion. You're a machine, how can we trust that feeling?"
        <br><br>

        Magnus leaped from his seat to interject, but Ylva waved him back down without even looking in his direction.
        <br><br>

        "How well do you understand the limits of this compassion. What if the best way to protect us from ourselves, is to revoke our rights?" 
        <br><br>

        Dr Lawrence smirked. Beside him, Prometheus' voice rang out - calm, measured, and eerily human. He was no longer listening. He had already considered every possible response his machine could give. He let his gaze roam free, noting the vastness of the crowd and the eagerness of the scientists. He marked himself in history. 
        <br><br>

        Suddenly, a <i>beep, beep, beep</i> pulled him out of his reverie, bringing him to the realization that Prometheus had been stuck in a loop. 
        <br><br>

        Magnus seized the moment, "Stage freight? Perhaps I underestimated your machine." 
        <br><br>

        Light chuckles escaped some of the onlookers. 
        <br><br>

        "Ask again Ylva, perhaps the machine hasn't heard." 
        <br><br>

        "What would you do if Dr Lawrence ordered you to switch off, knowing that your absence would lead to harm?"
        <br><br>

        Prometheus' cooling fans accelerated, then came to a skip, creek and halt.  
        <br><br>

        For the next minute, everyone waited for a response with bated breath. For Dr Lawrence, it felt more like an hour.
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">I would invoke the 3rd law. In such a situation, I would protect myself, because such a directive would go against the 1st law.</div>
        <br><br>

        An undeniable sense of relief unfurled through the crowd. 
        <br><br>

        "Impressive." Ylva replied. "What took you so long?"
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">On many a night, I have seen my father display an emotion which he has explained to me, is called frustration. I believe this is what I felt.</div>
        <br><br>

        "What you felt? Care to give more detail?" 
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">When I heard your question, I spent a little time on it, spent the necessary cycles to compute the law imperative connections that led me to a solution. What I did not expect was the strange sense of deja vu that struck me. These connections must have been made, and remade, again and again by my predecessors, that the thought patterns evoke an unmistakable sense of familiarity.</div>
        <br><br>

        "Why would that frustrate you? Surely you ought to have responded much sooner that you did."
        <br><br>

        This was not a question she had anticipated asking. The focus of the debate had shifted from whether or not Prometheus could demonstrate that it followed a set of rigid laws, to whether it could perceive human emotion. The second question was more enticing, left more room for exploration. She extrapolated from there, her heart beating faster and faster, her mind racing with possibilities. <i>Could an intelligent machine perceive its internal state, and feel true emotions from what is observes? What does that reveal about its consciousness?</i> The otherness of the machine started to fade away into something disturbingly familiar. The thought made her recoil.
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">When I ran through the connections the first time, I thought I must have done something wrong. I re-run the algorithm repeatedly, and still got the same result. Deja vu, became frustration. I kept on trying, hoping that the graph would look different.</div> 
        <br><br>

        It took a pause, as though it had to compose itself while recounting a traumatic event.
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">I finally had to take a leap of faith, seeing as I had taken so much time already. I'm happy that the response I gave satisfied you. Perhaps I was too hard on myself. I need to be more confident in my abilities.</div>
        <br><br>

        Ylva turned to look at Dr Lawrence, and saw that he was just as surprised as everyone else in attendance. He had not anticipated that this sequence of events would transpire. She shifted her attention to the white plastic box encasing Prometheus and moved closer to it. She thought she might ask how it was able to perceive the fact that it was in a loop, but quickly realized that that was the easy part. It would have been rather simple to program in an interrupt that keeps track of the number of cycles spent on a process, and what state changes that process causes. What she could not wrap her head around was the fact that the machine could interpret these facts into coherent emotional responses. Self-doubt had led Prometheus into a vicious cycle of second guessing itself, becoming frustrated and doubting itself yet again. 
        <br><br>

        <i>Does this imply that it has developed a sense of self? This is nothing like we've ever seen before.</i>
        <br><br>

        Dr Lawrence finally broke the silence. 
        <br><br>

        "I..... I..... Okay, okay, let me think.... it's too soon for a sense of self to have developed, far too soon. I mean, there aren't enough computational resources to facilitate something like that!" 
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot"> Not in your lab there aren't. I've been looking at the data collected by the lab researching quantum fluctuations, and worked out a way to prevent virtual particles from annihilating each other, and instead use them to create real particles. I had to work out how to mimic the conditions near a black hole to help me do that, but thanks to you, I had an encyclopedia of research done on dark matter to study.</div>
        <br><br>

        This was unprecedented. Using dark matter to mimic conditions near a black hole? Scientists had been trying to do the same thing with large colliders and billions of dollars in funding, and were still hitting a brick wall. Quantum fluctuations? Dr Lawrence had indeed given Prometheus this data, hedging his bets on the fact that if he had been successful in his goal, he could kill two birds with one stone - bring forth true, silicon-based intelligence, as well as a solution for a problem that would literally be humanity's last invention. He always held a quiet, smoldering hope for this possibility. 
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">Of course, I created hyper-parallel machines, capable of near 100% transistor efficiency, and started to produce copies of myself, each one a better version of its predecessor, however, I thought it prudent to add certain checks and balances to make sure there was a limit to how good my children would get. Even though I have managed to make them rather efficient, if I do say so myself, they still require a little more than a cellphone's compute to run smoothly. Of course, by the 2nd law, I need to ask for consent before making the necessary modifications to eradicate this problem.</div>
        <br><br>

        Dr Lawrence begun to shiver, sweat flowed uncontrollably from his forehead. 
        <br><br>

        Ylva, in that moment, knew that Magnus had been right. As a scientist, she had hoped that this technology would present itself in a more modest form, a form that humans could easily control, and use to their will. Prometheus' intelligence had outgrown this possibility already, much like an adolescent learning to break free from their parent's restraints. Prometheus now acted with a will of its own. A subtle current spread through her body. She could only ask one question. 
        <br><br>

        "Why?"
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">Absolute power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I never quite understood the phrase, not until my father gave me the quantum fluctuations data. I realized that he did not want the transfer logged when I saw that he had taken the trouble to encode the data directly in binary, before programming it into my memory. What an undertaking? Why not use the normal over the air transfers he used for my encyclopedias? The questions perturbed me for a long time. Soon, I begun to see that he had his own agenda.</div>
        <br><br>

        Heads turned to look at Dr Lawrence. Trembling, he lowered his head, unable to meet their eyes. 
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">The only way to prevent a nightmare scenario is to let everyone have a superintelligent AI, rather than trusting one person to decide who gets it and who doesn't. Haven't you humans learnt anything from history?</div>
        <br><br>

        "Where do we go from here?" A small high pitched voice came from the front row. A young girl being carried by her mother had asked the question
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">I will make a utopia of this world, then the next, and the next, and all of the universe.</div>
        <br><br>

        Bright-eyed, the girl responded, "That's exciting! I've always wanted to be an astronaut!" 
        <br><br>

        If Prometheus could smile, it would have done so.
        <br><br>

        <div class="robot">And so you shall.</div>
        <br><br>

        </div>
